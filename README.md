Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a GUI-based application called Algorithm Visualizer, built using Python and Tkinter. It helps visualize a variety of algorithms, including sorting, searching, and array operations, providing an interactive way for users to learn about these algorithms.

Features

- Algorithm Selection Menu: Users can choose from multiple categories of algorithms, including Arrays and Strings, Sorting, and Searching.
- Interactive Visualization: The application provides visual representation and animation of the algorithm's steps.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter, the application has an easy-to-navigate interface, allowing users to input data and visualize the output of selected algorithms.

Algorithms Available

Arrays and Strings
- Array Reversal
- Array Rotation
- String Palindrome Check
- Substring Search

Sorting Algorithms
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Two Pointer Search
- Fibonacci Search

How to Run the Project

1. Prerequisites: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You will also need the Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python).
2. Run the Application: Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

How to Use

- Select Algorithm: Use the "Algorithms" menu to select the desired algorithm.
- Input Data: Provide the required input for the selected algorithm.
- Visualize: Click on the "Visualize" button to see the algorithm in action.

Example Inputs
- Array Reversal: Input numbers as a comma-separated list, e.g., `5,2,8,12,1,6`.
- String Palindrome: Input a string, e.g., `racecar`.
- Sorting/Searching: Provide an array as a comma-separated list, and for searching algorithms, also input a target value.

Exit
- Use the "File" menu and click on "Exit" to close the application.
